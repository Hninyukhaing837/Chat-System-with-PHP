       <h2>English Language Club-ELC </h2>


<h4 >What's ELC?</h4>

<p1 id="para">ELC is the short term of English Language Club which was one of the clubs and currently running in our university,Technological University (Hmawbi).</p1><br><br>



<h4>What is that club for?</h4>
<p2 id="para">ELC is for everyone who's currently learning English and has an interest on English Language because we share knowledge and facts about any subject, people, country and so many things using English.<br>
 So we don't need to have any level in English and the fact is, we are not going to teach but train members to be brave to speak out in public, to share knowledge to each other and to make a more convenient atmosphere with mates who are eager to learn English. Besides, the main problem of foreign language learning students is that they don't dare to speak out but we want to do and they don't know how to do. That's why we are here and we believe that people who join our club will be the best speaker in English and killer of all presentation.
</p2><br><br><br><br><br>
<h4>How are we running the club? </h4>
<p2 id="para">
We are running ELC every Friday from 1:00PM to 2:30 PM(Activity Time) with many fun activities that will make members more happy and raise their passion to learn and share. <br>
  1.  First, we start it with Introduction Session that all members will have to introduce at least their names and something they did recently to each other. <br>
  2.  We will have a Game Session that will make them feel comfortable with club and new comers for we have seen that most of the new comers are afraid in their very first time.<br>
  3.  We will give a presentation to them by one of our volunteers about something that was announced on our Facebook Page. They could have learnt how to give a presentation very well. And after that, they will have a small activity like writing their dreams down on paper or have a discussion with groups then, one of the representative will share what they had discussed in their group.<br>
  4.  Then, our volunteers will share some knowledgeable facts to them for we want them to be knowledgeable in English then they will have many new vocabularies to expand effectively their conversations.<br> 
  5.  Finally, we will finish the activity by saying closing speech by one of our volunteers and we will invite them to join again. (Song Session will be included but optional).<br><br>

(It will cost some fees , not more than 3000kyats but I'm sure that you'll be glad to join us and we also have a plan to give certificate to members who join the club every week.)
